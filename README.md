- Development Roadmap AI Builder

## Introduction

The Development Roadmap AI Builder is a cutting-edge tool designed to guide developers through the maze of learning paths necessary to excel in the modern tech landscape. Leveraging data from roadmap.sh, and eventually from other premier tutorial sites like freeCodeCamp and Medium, this platform aims to provide a personalized, evolving roadmap for learning various tech stacks and disciplines including AI, backend, frontend, and more.

Our vision is to create a dynamic learning environment that not only suggests a customized curriculum based on the latest and most relevant resources but also evolves with the changing tech ecosystem. By incorporating simple tests, daily study goals, and project-based validations, we aim to offer a tailored educational journey that aligns with each learner's pace and preferences.

## Current Status

- **Roadmap Data Integration**: We have successfully integrated roadmap.sh data to display a variety of developmental roadmaps in a Streamlit app. This forms the backbone of our project by providing a broad overview of learning paths in areas like AI, backend, frontend, and other essential tech domains.

- **UI Implementation**: A basic Streamlit interface has been implemented to allow users to browse through different roadmaps. While functional, this interface is slated for significant aesthetic and usability enhancements.

## Future Tasks

### 1. Roadmap Builder AI
Develop an AI that can dynamically build comprehensive learning roadmaps by analyzing available data sources. This AI will serve as the core engine, suggesting learning paths tailored to the latest tech trends and individual learner profiles.

### 2. Detailed Roadmap Content Creation AI
Craft an AI capable of generating detailed content for each step of the learning roadmap. This includes identifying and curating the best tutorials, articles, and videos from a wide range of sources to ensure learners have access to the best possible materials.

### 3. Learner Progress Tracking AI
Implement an AI system that monitors learners' progress, adjusts the curriculum based on their pace, and provides regular feedback. This component is crucial for a personalized learning experience, ensuring learners stay engaged and on track.

### 4. Integration and System Unification
The final phase involves integrating all components into a cohesive system. This includes beautifying the Streamlit app, refining the AI's suggestions, and ensuring seamless data flow between the roadmap builder, content creator, and progress tracker.

## Immediate Next Steps

- **Refactoring and Enhancements**: The current Streamlit app requires refactoring for improved performance and scalability. Additionally, UI enhancements are needed to provide a more engaging user experience.

- **Roadmap-Based Todo App**: Prepare for the integration of a todo app or sprinter to further personalize the learning experience, allowing users to set and track daily or weekly goals based on their roadmap.

## Conclusion

The Development Roadmap AI Builder stands at the forefront of educational innovation, offering a tailored, evolving, and interactive learning experience for developers. By continually adapting to the latest tech developments and individual learner needs, we aim to provide an unparalleled educational journey that not only teaches but also inspires.
